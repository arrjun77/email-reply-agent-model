Email Reply Agent with Telegram Integration

Overview

The Email Reply Agent is an intelligent automation system for handling incoming emails. It uses advanced natural language processing to classify the intent of each email and generate appropriate replies. The system integrates with Gmail for reading and optionally sending emails, and with Telegram for real-time review of replies.

Key capabilities include:

Fetches unread emails from Gmail using the Gmail API

Classifies email intent using zero-shot learning with a transformer model

Generates professional replies using an instruction-tuned language model

Sends generated replies to a Telegram bot for review

Optionally sends the reply email directly back to the original sender

The project is built using Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Google OAuth2, and the Telegram Bot API.
